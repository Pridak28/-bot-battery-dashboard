## Technical Details

### Data Sources
- **FR Revenue**: From FR Simulator historical data
- **PZU Profit**: From PZU Horizons analysis
- **Projections**: Based on annualized historical averages
- **Debt Schedule**: Calculated using standard loan amortization formula

### Calculations
- **Annualization**: Partial year data properly extrapolated to 12 months
- **Debt Service**: Equal monthly payments (amortizing loan)
- **ROI**: Net profit after debt / Total investment Ã— 100
- **Payback Period**: Year when cumulative cashflow becomes positive

### Export Format
- **Excel**: OpenPyXML format (.xlsx)
- **CSV**: UTF-8 encoded
- **Currency**: Formatted as â‚¬X,XXX.XX
- **Dates**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Best Practices

1. **Always run simulators first**
   - FR Simulator with latest data
   - PZU Horizons for same period
   - Ensures export has complete data

2. **Select appropriate date ranges**
   - Use full years when possible
   - At least 12 months of data recommended
   - System automatically annualizes partial years

3. **Configure realistic parameters**
   - Operating costs based on actual estimates
   - Loan terms matching market conditions
   - Conservative projections for bank submissions

4. **Include multiple scenarios**
   - Export with different financing structures
   - Compare optimistic vs conservative forecasts
   - Show both FR and PZU options

5. **Keep audit trail**
   - Save timestamped exports
   - Document parameter changes
   - Track actual vs projected performance

## Troubleshooting

**Export button shows error:**
- Ensure FR Simulator and PZU Horizons ran successfully
- Check that session data is populated
- Try refreshing the page and running simulators again

**Missing data in sheets:**
- Some sheets may be empty if data unavailable
- Run both FR and PZU simulators for complete export
- Check date range selection includes data

**Numbers don't match simulator:**
- Export uses annualized averages for projections
- Partial year data is extrapolated to 12 months
- Review year selection filters in Investment section
